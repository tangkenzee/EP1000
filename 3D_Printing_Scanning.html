    <h1>3D Printing & Scanning</h1>
    <p>3D printing is a way of creating three dimensional (3D) solid objects.3D printing is done by building up the object layer by layer.Usually, 3D printers use plastic, because it is easier to use and cheaper. Some 3D printers can 3D print with other materials, like metals and ceramics, but they cost too much money for most people.</p>
    <p>The pro's of having a 3D printer:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>3D printers can make new objects very fast, and are good at making them very detailed</li>
        <li>An engineer can test a lot of new designs and not have to wait for someone else to make them</li>
        <li>They are also useful for fixing parts made of plastic, and for making toys, figures, and models</li>
    </ul>
